## This repository contains the code for the e-logical website, which showcases our services and previous projects.



### The site is built using React, Node, and Express, with a design styled using Tailwind CSS.
 In addition to these technologies, we also utilize MongoDB for data storage, as well as CSS, JavaScript, and HTML for front-end development.


### At e-logical, we are committed to staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends and best practices,
delivering high-quality user-friendly web applications and we are constantly seeking out new tools and frameworks to add to our skill set.
 Thank you for visiting our repository and considering e-logical for your web development needs.
